# PRODIGY_ML_02
📘 Project Overview

This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can help the business design targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall sales performance.

📊 Problem Statement

Retail businesses often have diverse customer bases with varying buying behaviors.
By segmenting customers into groups based on their purchasing patterns, the store can:

Understand customer behavior more effectively
